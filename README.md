# DL- Developing a Neural Network Classification Model using Transfer Learning

## AIM
To develop an image classification model using transfer learning with VGG19 architecture for the given dataset.

## THEORY


## Neural Network Model
Include the neural network model diagram.

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1: 
Import required libraries and define image transforms.

### STEP 2: 
Load training and testing datasets using ImageFolder.


### STEP 3: 
Visualize sample images from the dataset.


### STEP 4: 
Load pre-trained VGG19, modify the final layer for binary classification, and freeze feature extractor layers.

### STEP 5: 
Define loss function (BCEWithLogitsLoss) and optimizer (Adam). Train the model and plot the loss curve.


### STEP 6: 
Evaluate the model with test accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and visualize predictions.
